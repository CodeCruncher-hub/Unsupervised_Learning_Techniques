# Unsupervised Learning Techniques Applied to Real-World Data
This repository demonstrates the application of various unsupervised learning techniques on different real-world datasets. We cover K-means clustering, anomaly detection, and the Apriori algorithm, each applied to distinct types of data to showcase their versatility and effectiveness.

# K-means Clustering on Customer Data:
We use K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By finding the optimal number of clusters and calculating the Silhouette score, we assess the quality of the clustering and gain insights into distinct customer groups.

# Anomaly Detection Using Credit Card Data:
Anomaly detection techniques are applied to credit card transaction data to identify potential fraudulent activities. By analyzing transaction patterns, we detect anomalies that deviate significantly from normal behavior, enhancing the security of credit card transactions.

# Apriori Algorithm on Bread Basket Data:
The Apriori algorithm is employed to uncover frequent itemsets and generate association rules from bread basket transaction data. This helps in understanding customer purchasing patterns and discovering items that are commonly bought together, which can inform inventory management and marketing strategies.

Each of these techniques is applied with detailed steps and explanations, providing a comprehensive guide to implementing unsupervised learning methods on diverse datasets.
